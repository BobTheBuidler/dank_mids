"""
This example demonstrates how to use dank_mids with Brownie for efficient blockchain data retrieval.

The following code will send just one http call to your node.

dank_mids integrates seamlessly with Brownie, allowing for batched and optimized RPC calls.
This can significantly improve performance when fetching large amounts of data from the blockchain.

Key features of dank_mids Brownie integration:
1. Automatic batching of eth_call operations into multicalls
2. Asynchronous execution of RPC calls
3. Easy-to-use interface that mimics standard Brownie patterns

Take note of the liberal use of `asyncio.gather`, this is how you ensure that all of the various parts of your code are running at the same time, and are therefore batchable.
