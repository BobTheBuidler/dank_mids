        Attempts to acquire the lock with an initial fixed timeout.

        This method first attempts to acquire the lock in a non-blocking manner with a timeout
        of 5 seconds. If this initial attempt is unsuccessful, a warning message is logged and
        a secondary acquisition attempt is made using the provided `blocking` and `timeout`
        parameters. Note that the return value of the secondary attempt is not captured or returned;
        this method always returns the result of the initial lock acquisition attempt.

        Parameters:
            blocking: Whether to block during the secondary acquisition attempt.
            timeout: The maximum time to wait during the secondary acquisition attempt.

        Returns:
            bool: The result from the initial lock acquisition attempt.

        Examples:
            >>> lock = AlertingRLock("example")
            >>> # Attempt to acquire the lock. If the initial 5-second attempt fails,
            >>> # a warning is logged and a secondary attempt is made.
            >>> result = lock.acquire(blocking=True, timeout=10)
